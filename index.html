        <p1>WASD to move image. "P" and "L" to switch between new and old, buttons to change image and add music. Hover mouse over image for more information. Random may roll same image, so click again if it does.</p1>
        <p2>I made this because I find really old photos interesting, because it’s entertaining to compare the differences between then and now, and having an old photo makes that comparison easier. It also give you a glimpse into how things used to be and how things have grown. Where it gets even more interesting is when you compare someplace you know or is famous, and you can’t get anymore famous than New York City. So I’ve made something that allows the user and myself to compare the old with the new in New York City.</p2>
